# Test-Driven Development with Django, Django REST Framework, and Docker

This project is a RESTful API using the Python programming language, Django web framework, Django REST Framework, and Postgres as the database. I demonstrate how to containerize the Django application and Postgres database using Docker for easy deployment and scalability. Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles are emphasized throughout the project, ensuring a robust and reliable API.
